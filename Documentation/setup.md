# Setup CosmosDB Emulator

1. Get [Azure CosmosDB Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator?tabs=ssl-netstd21). This allows you to test most of the functionality without having to use a microsoft account and having to set up a CosmosDB account.
1. Open data explorer (CosmosDB Emulator Tray Icon) and copy your primary connection string. Provide this connection string as an environment variable when running by adding it to Server/Properties/launchSettings.json as `AzureCosmosConnectionString`

# Build and Run

Configure compiler flags and optional environment variables if you want. Initialise your dotnet environment and Build the project.
Whenever the database service does not find the required tables present it creates those and adds some default data. Open your browser and navigate to [https:://localhost:7196/chat](https:://localhost:7196/chat), then authenticate with `testuser` and `password`. Refer to the AdminApi to generate and configure more users.

(You can connect from other devices in the local network via `https://<HostingComputersLocalIp>:7196/chat`)
